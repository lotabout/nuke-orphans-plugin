# Nuke Orphans Obsidian Plugin
Simple plugin that trashes orphaned attachments (or all files) using a command

## [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)
The plugin provides three commands
- `nuke-orphaned-attachments` which looks for orphaned attachments
- `nuke-orphaned-notes` which looks for orphaned notes
- `nuke-orphaned` which looks for all orphaned files

**The plugin will always ask you if you want to trash files**\
